Description: Estimates DNA target concentration by classifying digital PCR droplets as positive, negative, or rain, using Mixture Model Clustering. Fitting is done using EMMIXskew package (v. 1.0.3) by Kui Wang, Angus Ng and Geoff McLachlan (2018) from their paper "Multivariate Skew t Mixture Models: Applications to Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting Data" <doi:10.1109/DICTA.2009.88>.
